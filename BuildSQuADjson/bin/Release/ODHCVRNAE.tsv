It is essential for preventing disease and for healing of disease. It is essential for emotional and physical well-being. MyPyramid program offers a personal eating plan with suggested foods and amount of food intake. They are not therapeutic diets for specific health conditions (see therapeutic diets teaching guides for specific health conditions. The program can track your food intake and physical activity level. They offer some basic advice when starting the program. It includes, making wise choices from every food group, finding a balance between food and physical activity, getting the most nutrition out of your calories, avoiding empty calories, staying within your daily calorie needs, making half your grains whole, varying your vegetables, focus on fruit selections, using calcium-rich foods, using lean proteins and finding a balance between food intake and physical activity. The US Department of Agriculture introduced this program in 2006. Methods to evaluate healthy weight are several, like, using Body mass index that was created to provide a measurement of weight that is not related to height. It is often used as an indicator of obesity. BMI of 25 to 29.5 is considered overweight. BMI over 30 is considered obese. Another method to evaluate a healthy weight is to use one of the height and weight tables. Adults and older children are measured standing. Infants and small children are measured lying on a flat surface.

What are the benefits of exercise?	Exercise strengthens your cardiovascular and respiratory systems, promotes feeling of emotional well-being and improved self-esteem, keeps bones and muscles strong, manages weight, prevents and manages diabetes, eases depression and manages pain and stress, It lowers the risk of colon, prostate, uterus, and breast cancer. It improves sleep habits and increases energy. There are four recommended types of exercise with four basic fitness components. They are cardiorespiratory endurance (examples are long runs and swims), muscular strength (weight-lifting exercises are an example), muscular endurance (pushups are a common example) and flexibility (using muscles to complete a full range of motion is an example). Each workout should begin with a warmup. General rules for exercise are to first get approval from a physician before beginning exercise program. If over 35 years old and sedentary or has a cardiovascular problem, then stop exercise, and notify a physician if chest pain, dizziness, or fainting occurs. Drink plenty of water before, during, and after the workout. Dress in loose-fitting clothing to permit freedom of movement. Wear supportive shoes. Wait 90 minutes after a meal to exercise. Avoid exercising in very hot or humid weather. Decrease the intensity of exercise if unable to hold a conversation during exercise. Have fun while exercising. Exercise with someone or with a group.

What are the benefits of immunization?	Immunization for both children and adults is one of the best examples of primary prevention. They prevent the initial occurrence of a specific disease. Vaccines contain a killed or weakened form or derivative of specific infectious germs. This vaccine given to a healthy person will trigger an immune response without exposure to the actual disease-producing germ. Later, if exposed to the real disease, the body will produce antibodies to destroy the disease. Possible reactions to childhood immunizations are Redness or swelling at the site of injection or rash or fever. Symptoms that need the prompt attention of a physician are Fever that lasts more than 3 days and Pain that lasts more than 3 days and an injection site that shows signs of infection. Never give aspirin for fever or pain to a child. Reye's syndrome is a rare but serious brain disease that can result from use of aspirin in children. Recommended immunizations for children and adults are as per 2007 schedule. Childhood immunizations should include Hepatitis B, Rotavirus, Diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Pneumococcal, Inactivated poliovirus, Influenza, Measles, mumps, and rubella, Varicella, HepatitisA, Meningococcal.  Adult immunizations should include tetanus/diphtheria/acellular pertussis (Td/Tdap), Human papillomavirus (HPV2) for females, Measles, mumps, and rubella, Varicella, Influenza, Pneumococcal, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Meningococcal. Contact health care provider or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on immunization schedules, requirements, and any updates.
