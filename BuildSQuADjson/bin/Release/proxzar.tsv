What is Proxzar?	Proxzar is an Artificial Intelligence powered platform where proxies of czars (subject matter experts) provide responses to queries from end users. Proxzar team has built Proxzar platform, where subject matter experts - supposedly with limited knowledge of AI, can create and host products (proxies). Proxzar team also provides professional services to large organizations in creating proxies for their own use. For e.g. to provide external customer service or internal employee self-service etc. Proxzar proxies can also be trained to facilitate new product development or help in driving innovations in an organization.For e.g., Proxies that are trained as a combination of bots and virtual assistants could be deployed to create a Voice of Customer (VoC) program that guides the innovation efforts.For a clear definition of new product development (NPD) or Innovation management or what is VoC, <a href=\https://pdma.org\ target=\_blank\>pl click here</a>. Understanding that subject matter experts have decades of experience in their respective domains, Proxzar platform was built such that they do not need to have a good knowledge of AI. All they have to do is to bring their original content to our platform and annotate it. Proxzar's AI alogirithms will take care of building, training and deploying a proxy of the expert.Proxzar platform also provides several tools for a subject matter expert to do final verification of his/her proxy before deploying LIVE and also, monitoring the performance of the proxy in real-time. We provide 1 week training for SMEs on how to use Proxzar platform. Proxzar's unique value proposition is scalability and budget-friendly for large organizations. Proxies built on Proxzar platform can be scaled by training with new knowledge. For e.g., a large organization can train a proxy on HR policies/standards and deploy the proxy on their HRMS portal for Employee Self-Service. The same proxy could be scaled by training with new knowledge, which now includes Quality Management Standards (ISO-9001 etc..). Budget-friendly means affordable! Organizations do not have to make upfront investment to implement AI technology. Instead, they can start small with a pilot app and gradually scale across by adding new knowledge or features to the proxies. Proxzar proxies that are trained using the data and content specific to the domain or subject area can provide the above information that can be acted upon.Inventory intelligence implies inferences that can be drawn from inventory data that might be stored in a structured format, like ERP or DMS or CMS systems or Spreadsheets etc. The usecase Online Product Catalog Search can be extended to look up information from inventory data sources like ERP or CMS systems.

what is a proxy?	A proxy provides responses 24x7 - as opposed to limited availability of czars (subject matter experts). A proxy could be built as a Virtual Assistant or a Chatbot or a Bot to automate certain business workflow or an Enterprise search application. Further, a proxy could be deployed as a web page widget or as a native mobile app or integrated directly into another web/mobile/enterprise app. In all of the above cases, to access respective proxies, end user should have registered on Proxzar platform and subscribed to the proxy's unique ID given by Proxzar platform.  Typically, it takes anywhere between 1 to 3 months to train and deploy LIVE a thoroughly trained proxy with 2 IT resources.

what technologies stack does proxzar use?	Proxzar uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and propreitary AI algorithms for building and training proxies (chatbots or virtual assistants or automation bots that use natural language). Natural languages are what humans use to share information with each other. E.g., English, French, Hindi etc. A computer program written with a programming language tells a machine exactly what to do. But there are no compilers or interpreters for natural languages such as English and French. Natural language processing is an area of research in computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with processing natural languages such as English or French. This processing generally involves translating natural language into data (numbers) that a computer can use to learn about the world. And this understanding of the world is sometimes used to generate natural language text that reflects that understanding. Natural language interface is one of many interface styles that can be used in the dialog between a human user and a computer. There is a significant appeal in being able to address a machine and direct its operations by using the same language we use in everyday human to human interaction. For more information on advantage and limitations of a natural language interface, <a href='https://www.proxzar.ai/blog/natural-language-interface-advantages-and-disadvantages/' target='_blank'>pl click here</a>. Natural language search implies searching structured data (like tables/databases etc..) or unstructured data (like documents, emails, books, websites etc..) using natural languages like English or French or Hindi etc. It is different from keyword based search in the sense that the AI application that provides a natural language interface understands the meaning of each word entered as search.

help me know what is actionable intelligence?	While there are several definitions of AI, the one that we see as a good one is the definition of Artificial Intelligence by <a href='http://jmc.stanford.edu/artificial-intelligence/what-is-ai/index.html' target='_blank'>Prof.McCarthy</a>. He says that AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence. Arthur Samuel says that Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Structured data is in a well-defined format, like a Spreadsheet or Database tables or XML format etc. Unstructured data does not follow a well-defined format, like a text document or a text in an email body etc. Actionable intelligence refers to the actions that can be taken from the information generated after processing certain data using computer algorithms. Proxzar proxies are trained from the content that was provided by subject matter experts. In other words, all the proxies are not trained based on some publicly available and un-verified content. The content used to train all Proxzar proxies is authenticated and curated by respective subject matter experts themselves. An infographic presents data in a visual format that is easy to understand by the end user. Proxzar has published several infographics to explain certain concepts using data. <a href=\https://proxzar.ai/resources/infographics\ target=\_blank\>Click here to see these infographics</a>. Inventory intelligence implies inferences that can be drawn from inventory data that might be stored in a structured format, like ERP or DMS or CMS systems or Spreadsheets etc. Discrete manufacturing is about making things that can be counted and often require assembly. For e.g., \how many\ items as in cars or phones or chairs etc.. Process manufacturing on the other side is about producing from a formula or recipe. For e.g., \how much\ needed as in 10 litres of fuel or 100 kgs of cement etc.       Actionable intelligence refers to the actions that can be taken from the information generated after processing certain data using computer algorithms. Omni-channel experience implies a single customer experience across mobile, web, social media and brick-mortar channels. Proxzar facilitates online omni-channel experience where a proxy could be acccessed across web or mobile or social channels or enterprise apps/portals. We regularly post articles on our blog. For recent articles and archives posted by Proxzar team members, pl <a href=\https://proxzar.ai/blog\ target=\_blank\>click here</a>. Budget-friendly means affordable! Organizations do not have to make upfront investment to implement AI technology.Instead, they can start small with a pilot app and gradually scale across by adding new knowledge or features to the proxies. Incremental Deployment implies training and deploying proxies incrementally by adding new knowledge during each increment. For e.g., a large organization can train a proxy on HR policies/standards and deploy the proxy on their HRMS portal for Employee Self-Service. The same proxy could be scaled by training with new knowledge, which now includes Quality Management Standards (ISO-9001 etc..). And, further it can be trained to do a look-up of inventory and provide actionable intelligence etc. Ease Of Deployment implies deploying proxies with few lines of code directly on organization's main website or as a tool in the organization's native apps or organization's social media channels or messaging platforms. Inventory intelligence implies inferences that can be drawn from inventory data that might be stored in a structured format, like ERP or DMS or CMS systems or Spreadsheets etc.

Proxzar facilitates online omni-channel experience where a proxy could be acccessed across web or mobile or social channels or enterprise apps/portals. We regularly post articles on our blog.

Organizations do not have to make upfront investment to implement AI technology.Instead, they can start small with a pilot app and gradually scale across by adding new knowledge or features to the proxies. Incremental Deployment implies training and deploying proxies incrementally by adding new knowledge during each increment. For e.g., a large organization can train a proxy on HR policies/standards and deploy the proxy on their HRMS portal for Employee Self-Service. The same proxy could be scaled by training with new knowledge, which now includes Quality Management Standards (ISO-9001 etc..). And, further it can be trained to do a look-up of inventory and provide actionable intelligence etc. Ease Of Deployment implies deploying proxies with few lines of code directly on organization's main website or as a tool in the organization's native apps or organization's social media channels or messaging platforms. Inventory intelligence implies inferences that can be drawn from inventory data that might be stored in a structured format, like ERP or DMS or CMS systems or Spreadsheets etc.
how is AI different from machine learning?	While there are several definitions of AI, the one that we see as a good one is the definition of Artificial Intelligence by <a href='http://jmc.stanford.edu/artificial-intelligence/what-is-ai/index.html' target='_blank'>Prof.McCarthy</a>. He says that AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence. Arthur Samuel says that Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Structured data is in a well-defined format, like a Spreadsheet or Database tables or XML format etc. Unstructured data does not follow a well-defined format, like a text document or a text in an email body etc. Actionable intelligence refers to the actions that can be taken from the information generated after processing certain data using computer algorithms. Proxzar proxies are trained from the content that was provided by subject matter experts. In other words, all the proxies are not trained based on some publicly available and un-verified content. The content used to train all Proxzar proxies is authenticated and curated by respective subject matter experts themselves. An infographic presents data in a visual format that is easy to understand by the end user. Proxzar has published several infographics to explain certain concepts using data. <a href=\https://proxzar.ai/resources/infographics\ target=\_blank\>Click here to see these infographics</a>. Inventory intelligence implies inferences that can be drawn from inventory data that might be stored in a structured format, like ERP or DMS or CMS systems or Spreadsheets etc. Discrete manufacturing is about making things that can be counted and often require assembly. For e.g., \how many\ items as in cars or phones or chairs etc.. Process manufacturing on the other side is about producing from a formula or recipe.
